# MS-E2112 Multivariate Statistical Analysis - Project work
## Data Source
In this project, I use the results of the most recent Premier League season 2018/2019. The data has 380 rows and 13 columns. Each row corresponds to a match of two teams (home team and away team). Each column corresponds to a specific attribute of the match. 
The dataset contains the following attributes: 

  * **“Matches”:** names of the home and away teams, in the format “HomeTeam v AwayTeam”. 
  * **“HTHG", “HTAG":** half time goals of the home and away team.
  * **“HTR":** half time results, 1, if the home team won, -1 if it lost, 0 for a draw.
  * **“HS", “AS":** number of shots by the home and the away team.
  * **“HST", “AST":** number of shots on target by the home and the away team. 
  * **“HF", “AF":** number of fouls by the home and away team.
  * **“HC", “AC":** number of corners of the home and away team.
  * **“FTG”:** total number of goals in the match.

## Research Questions
Concretely, this project aims at providing the fully explained, detailed answers for the following questions: 
1. To which extent are the different attributes correlated to each other? 
2. Is it possible to explain the variances in the metrics with fewer components? If yes, what could those components be and how much could they explain the variances? 
3. Is there a similarity between the group of matches? If yes, what are these similarities?
4. What are the necessary models or algorithms that help classify the matches into appropriate groups of similarity?
